/**

 * \brief PHOTON-Beetle authenticated encryption algorithm.
 *
 * PHOTON-Beetle is a family of authenticated encryption algorithms based
 * on the PHOTON-256 permutation and using the Beetle sponge mode.
 * There are three algorithms in the family:
 *
 * \li PHOTON-Beetle-AEAD-ENC-128 with a 128-bit key, a 128-bit nonce, and a
 * 128-bit tag.  Data is handled in 16 byte blocks.  This is the primary
 * member of the family for encryption.
 * \li PHOTON-Beetle-AEAD-ENC-32 with a 128-bit key, a 128-bit nonce, and a
 * 128-bit tag.  Data is handled in 4 byte blocks.
 * \li PHOTON-Beetle-Hash with a 256-bit hash output.  The initial data is
 * handled as a 16 byte block, and then the remaining bytes are processed
 * in 4 byte blocks.
 *
