 * immediately feeding it back in as seed material.
 *
 * The effect of feeding the rate back into itself is to set the rate
 * block to zero.  When we permute the state afterwards, the rate will
 * be set to something else.  An attacker would need to be able to guess
 * the non-zeroed bits in the previous state to roll the state backwards,
 * which should be infeasible with this construction.
 *
 * The SpongePRNG paper recommends repeating the process ceil(c/r) times,
 * which is ceil((32 - PHOTON_BEETLE_PRNG_RATE) / PHOTON_BEETLE_PRNG_RATE).
