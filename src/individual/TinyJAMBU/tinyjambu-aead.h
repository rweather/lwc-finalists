 * \brief TinyJAMBU authenticated encryption algorithm.
 *
 * TinyJAMBU is a family of encryption algorithms that are built around a
 * lightweight 128-bit permutation.  There are three variants of TinyJAMBU
 * with different key sizes:
 *
 * \li TinyJAMBU-128 with a 128-bit key, a 96-bit nonce, and a 64-bit tag.
 * This is the primary member of the family.
 * \li TinyJAMBU-192 with a 192-bit key, a 96-bit nonce, and a 64-bit tag.
 * \li TinyJAMBU-256 with a 256-bit key, a 96-bit nonce, and a 64-bit tag.
 *
 * TinyJAMBU has one of the smallest RAM and flash memory footprints
 * out of all the algorithms in this library.
