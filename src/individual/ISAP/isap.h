/**

 * \brief ISAP authenticated encryption algorithm.
 *
 * ISAP is a family of authenticated encryption algorithms that are built
 * around the Keccak-p[400] or ASCON permutations.  There are four algorithms
 * in the family, each of which have a 128-bit key, a 128-bit nonce, and a
 * 128-bit tag:
 *
 * \li ISAP-K-128A based around the Keccak-p[400] permutation with a
 * reduced number of rounds.  This is the primary member in the family.
 * \li ISAP-A-128A based around the ASCON permutation with a reduced
 * number of rounds.
 * \li ISAP-K-128 based around the Keccak-p[400] permutation.
 * \li ISAP-A-128 based around the ASCON permutation.
 *
 * ISAP is designed to provide some protection against adversaries
 * using differential power analysis to determine the key.  The
 * downside is that key setup is very slow.
