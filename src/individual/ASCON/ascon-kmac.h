/**

 * \brief Keyed Message Authentication Code (KMAC) based on ASCON-XOF.
 *
 * The KMAC mode provides a method to authenticate a sequence of bytes
 * using ASCON in hashing mode.  The output is essentially equivalent to
 * hashing the key followed by the data.
 *
 * NIST SP 800-185 is an extension of the XOF modes SHAKE128 and SHAKE256.
 * The nearest equivalent for us is ASCON-XOF.  We use the same encoding
 * as NIST SP 800-185 to provide domain separation between the key and data.
 *
 * Two versions of KMAC are provided: ASCON-KMAC based around ASCON-XOF,
 * and ASCON-KMACA based around ASCON-XOFA.
 *
 * References: NIST SP 800-185
