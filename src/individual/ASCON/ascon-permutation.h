/**
 * \file ascon-permutation.h
 * \brief API for raw access to the ASCON permutation.
 *
 * This API implements the SnP "state and permutation" representation
 * for the ASCON state.  Functions are provided for adding input data
 * to the state, performing permutations, and extracting output data.
 *
 * The ASCON state has two modes: "traditional" and "operational".
 * In the traditional mode, the bytes are laid out in the standard
 * big-endian order.  In the "operational" mode, the bytes may be laid
 * out in a different platform-dependent order for greater efficiency.
 *
 * Most functions expect the state to be in operational mode.
 * The application can call ascon_from_operational() to convert to
 * the traditional order so that it can more easily extract data
 * from the state directly.
 *
 * The application can also populate data into the state in the
 * traditional order and call ascon_to_operational() to convert
 * it into operational mode for other functions.  This may be useful
 * when initializing the state with a starting arrangement of
 * keys, nonces, and initialization vector values.
 *
