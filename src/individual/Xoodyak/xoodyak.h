/**
 * \file xoodyak.h
 * \brief Xoodyak authenticated encryption algorithm.
 *
 * Xoodyak is an authenticated encryption and hash algorithm pair based
 * around the 384-bit Xoodoo permutation that is similar in structure to
 * Keccak but is more efficient than Keccak on 32-bit embedded devices.
 * The Cyclist mode of operation is used to convert the permutation
 * into a sponge for the higher-level algorithms.
 *
 * The Xoodyak encryption mode has a 128-bit key, a 128-bit nonce,
 * and a 128-bit authentication tag.  The Xoodyak hashing mode has a
 * 256-bit fixed hash output and can also be used as an extensible
 * output function (XOF).
 *
 * The Xoodyak specification describes a re-keying mechanism where the
 * key for one packet is used to derive the key to use on the next packet.
 * This provides some resistance against side channel attacks by making
 * the session key a moving target.  This library does not currently
 * implement re-keying.
 *
