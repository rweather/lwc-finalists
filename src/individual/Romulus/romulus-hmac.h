 * \brief Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) based on Romulus-H.
 *
 * The HMAC mode provides a method to authenticate a sequence of bytes
 * using Romulus-H as the underlying digest algorithm.
 *
 * HMAC uses an underlying block size to pad the key data.
 * The Romulus-H block absorption rate of 32 bytes is too short
 * so we use the HMAC-SHA-256 block size of 64 instead.
 *
 * \note The KMAC construction is preferable for sponge-based hash
 * algorithms as it is simpler and more efficient.  HMAC mode is
 * provided for drop-in compatibility with existing designs.
 *
 * Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104
