/**

 * \brief Romulus authenticated encryption algorithm family.
 *
 * Romulus is a family of authenticated encryption algorithms that
 * are built around the SKINNY-128-384+ tweakable block cipher.  There
 * are two members in the family:
 *
 * \li Romulus-N+ has a 128-bit key, a 128-bit nonce, and a 128-bit tag,
 * based around the SKINNY-128-384+ tweakable block cipher.  This is the
 * primary member of the family.
 * \li Romulus-M+ has a 128-bit key, a 128-bit nonce, and a 128-bit tag,
 * based around the SKINNY-128-384+ tweakable block cipher.
 *
 * The Romulus-M variants are resistant to nonce reuse as long as the
 * combination of the associated data and plaintext is unique.  If the
 * same associated data and plaintext are reused under the same nonce,
 * then the scheme will leak that the same plaintext has been sent for a
 * second time but will not reveal the plaintext itself.
