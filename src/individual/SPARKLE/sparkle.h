/**

 * \brief Encryption and hash algorithms based on the SPARKLE permutation.
 *
 * SPARKLE is a family of encryption and hash algorithms that are based
 * around the SPARKLE permutation.  There are three versions of the
 * permutation with 256-bit, 384-bit, and 512-bit state sizes.
 * The algorithms in the family are:
 *
 * \li Schwaemm256-128 with a 128-bit key, a 256-bit nonce, and a 128-bit tag.
 * This is the primary encryption algorithm in the family.
 * \li Schwaemm192-192 with a 192-bit key, a 192-bit nonce, and a 192-bit tag.
 * \li Schwaemm128-128 with a 128-bit key, a 128-bit nonce, and a 128-bit tag.
 * \li Schwaemm256-256 with a 256-bit key, a 256-bit nonce, and a 256-bit tag.
 * \li Esch256 hash algorithm with a 256-bit digest output.  This is the
 * primary hash algorithm in the family.
 * \li Esch384 hash algorithm with a 384-bit digest output.
