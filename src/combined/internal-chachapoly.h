 * \brief ChaChaPoly implementation for performance comparisons.
 *
 * ChaChaPoly is not one of the NIST lightweight submissions.  We use
 * it as a baseline to evaluate the performance of other ciphers.
 * For example, a performance result of "1.2 ChaChaPolys" means
 * that the algorithm is 1.2 times faster than ChaChaPoly on the
 * same input data on the same hardware.
 *
 * This ChaChaPoly implementation is based on the one from the
 * <a href="http://rweather.github.com/arduinolibs/crypto.html">Arduino
 * Cryptography Library</a>.
