 * \brief BLAKE2s implementation for performance comparisons.
 *
 * BLAKE2s is not one of the NIST lightweight submissions.  We use
 * it as a baseline to evaluate the performance of other hash algorithsm.
 * For example, a performance result of "1.2 BLAKE's" means that the
 * algorithm is 1.2 times faster than BLAKE2s on the same input data
 * on the same hardware.
 *
 * This BLAKE2s implementation is based on the one from the
 * <a href="http://rweather.github.com/arduinolibs/crypto.html">Arduino
 * Cryptography Library</a>.
