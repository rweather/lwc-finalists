 * \brief Grain-128AEAD authenticated encryption algorithm.
 *
 * Grain-128AEAD is an authenticated encryption algorithm based around a
 * combination of a 128-bit linear feedback shift register (LFSR) and a
 * 128-bit non-linear feedback shift register (NFSR).  It is a member of
 * the Grain family of stream ciphers.
