LWC Finalists
=============

This repository contains implementations of the 10 finalists 
in the [NIST lightweight cryptography competition](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography): ASCON, Elephant, GIFT-COFB, Grain128-AEAD, ISAP, Photon-Beetle, Romulus, Sparkle, TinyJambu, and Xoodyak.

The [documentation](https://rweather.github.io/lwc-finalists/index.html)
contains more information on the algorithms and their performance.

This repository was forked off my previous repository for the
[round 2 candidates](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography/round-2-candidates).  Only submissions that made it to the final round are
included in this fork.

As the final round of the competition unfolds, I will endeavour to update
these implementations to match the author's adjustments.
